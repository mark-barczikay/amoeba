# amoeba

Amoeba is an eastern european version of Gomoku, played on an infinite grid. 
This python program plays against you. Each turn you place an "X" on a free square 
and the goal is to place 5 in a row.

Download all the files into a folder. Install pygame, and start Amoeba by running the
amoba_pve.py file.
